# New Component

#### **`New Component`** is a component that can be used to display informations about an object.

-> You can display multiple things like:
- The *object name* 
- The *object description*
- The *object state*
- The *object owner*

### Preview of standard usage:

<Canvas of={NewComponentStories.Standard} />

## Interaction:

The user has the possibility to click on the **`demande`** button to make a request to the owner of the objects. This action displays an alert element on the screen. 

## Context data:

You have to pass 4 context data to the component in order to render it:
1. **`main_title`**, which correspond to the name of the object,
2. **`description`**, which correspond to the description of the object,
3. **`comment`**, which gives more information about the object,
4. **`owner`**, which informs who is the owner of the object 

## Slots:

You can override an `'image'` slot to give a visual description about the object.

<Canvas of={NewComponentStories.Advanced} />

<details><summary></summary>
<Controls of={NewComponentStories.Advanced} />
</details>

Here we just passed the following img element to the 'title' slot and so overriding it:
```html 
<img src="static/django_components_app/image.jpg" alt="Object picture" class="image_descr" />
```
